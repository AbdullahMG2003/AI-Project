Introduction
In this project, we aim to develop a Connect Four game implementation with an AI opponent capable of providing an engaging and challenging gaming experience for players. The motivation behind this project is to combine elements of strategic gameplay and artificial intelligence algorithm to create a compelling gaming environment. Connect Four is a popular two-player game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertically suspended grid, aiming to form a line of four discs of their own color either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. By integrating AI algorithms into the game, we seek to enhance the player experience by offering competitive gameplay against an intelligent virtual opponent.


Background or Literature Review
Previous research and existing literature on Connect Four game implementations have explored various strategies and algorithms for optimizing gameplay. Traditional approaches have focused on brute-force search methods, such as minimax with alpha-beta pruning, to evaluate potential moves and select the best one. However, these methods may suffer from computational complexity, especially in deeper search trees. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have introduced more sophisticated techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning, to train AI agents to play games effectively. While these approaches have shown promising results in other games like Chess and Go, their application to Connect Four remains relatively unexplored. Therefore, there is an opportunity to investigate and develop AI algorithms tailored specifically for Connect Four to enhance gameplay and provide players with a challenging opponent.


Methods and Materials
To develop the Connect Four game implementation, we utilized the Pygame library for creating the graphical user interface and handling user input. The game logic includes functions for managing the game state, detecting winning conditions, and generating AI moves using the alpha-beta pruning algorithm. The graphical interface features a grid representing the game board and colored discs for each player, providing a visually appealing and intuitive gaming experience. Performance evaluation metrics include measuring the AI player's success rate in winning games against human opponents and analyzing the efficiency of the alpha-beta pruning algorithm in selecting optimal moves.


Data and Results
The data used in the project consists of game board states and player actions, which are processed and analyzed to evaluate the performance of the AI player. Results from running the alpha-beta pruning algorithm demonstrate its effectiveness in selecting optimal moves, leading to competitive gameplay against human opponents. Performance evaluation against
 
human players confirms the challenging nature of the AI opponent, providing an engaging gaming experience for players.


Conclusion
In conclusion, the Connect Four game implementation with an AI opponent offers an enjoyable and challenging gaming experience for players. The use of the alpha-beta pruning algorithm enables intelligent decision-making by the AI player, resulting in competitive gameplay. While the project demonstrates success in achieving its objectives, there are limitations to consider, such as computational complexity and potential for further optimization. Future research could explore alternative AI algorithms and strategies to enhance gameplay and address any identified limitations.
